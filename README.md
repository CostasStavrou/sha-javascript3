Look at the [SHA JavaScript-Old repo](https://github.com/SocialHackersCodeSchool/JavaScript-Old)
for details.

## Week 1 of JavaScript module 3

This week the exercises have to do mostly with using map, filter,
and reduce Array functions and the use of arrow functions in JavaScript.


### First assignment

- Add map, filter, reduce to  your existing app to build an application that loads data from github, filters out based on certain value, map->reduces to a data object and render that object to the dom (using map again).
- For example you can try to use map, filter and reduce to show the most and the least forked repositories, watched repositories. And the total number of forks for all repo's. Also you can work with the data provided about the amount of commits or contributers.
